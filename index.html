<p>Semantic elements, often used in HTML5 are coding elements that clearly define meaning to both the browser and the developer.</p>
<p>Semantic HTML5 tags are used to enhance acessibility, serchability, internationalization and interoperability. These are used in place of div tags.</p>

<p>Examples of <b>semantic</b> elements include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tables</li>
      <li>Forms</li>
      <li>Articles</li>
    </ul>

<p>Semantic elements are not to be confused with <em>non-semantic</em> elements, which don't define content. The two, most common examples of non-semantic elements include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>div tags</li>
      <li>span tags</li>
    </ol>
</section>
